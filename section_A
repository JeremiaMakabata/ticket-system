SELECT CONCAT(C.FirstName, " ", C.LastName) as CustomerName, SUM(OI_.UnitPrice )as AmountSpend, 
FROM Customer AS C
JOIN Order AS O ON O.CustomerId = C.CustomerId
JOIN OrderItem AS OI_ ON OI_.OrderId = O.OrderId
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10
);

-- Top 10 customers by purchase (count) - QUANTITY OVER QUALITY

GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10
);

CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXIST to_3_sales_by_profit AS (
SELECT EmployeeName, SUM(Profit) FROM (SELECT CONCAT(E.FirstName, " ", E.LastName) as EmployeeName, (P.UnitPrice - P.SupplierPrice) AS Profit
FROM Employeee AS E
